# Java-102
Starting from Grid on Git hub, I had a friend help me as I am on a timecrunch. After turning in this assignment, I will be taking time to go over Java 102 in its entirety. The reason I didn't want to ask for another extion is because it kind of felt embarrassing asking for another one. Also Kickoffs is starting so I didn't want to fall behind. Currently, I have a general understanding; but I want to understand the material in its entirety. After understanding everythin, I will attempt to rewrite the code in my own ways if I think the code can be altered.
